# Spelling Exceptions
# Format - lines beginning # are comments
# one word per line, to define a file override use ' - filename'
# where filename is relative to this config file

# Platform DXC Spelling tips:
# - Case is important.  Where there is a proper noun, or a word with special case, keep it with the ideal case below so usages of it without proper case will flag.
# - Add any formal names not recognized to .spelling section below
# - Keep proper names (vendors, etc.) properly capitalized; don't add their lowercase equivalents to .spelling, so they properly flag to be fixed
# - Acronyms are already set to be ignored (mdspell -a), so long as they are fully capitalized and aren't needed here in those cases; only add mixed case acronyms
# - Spelling set to look for US English; fix any other spelling to align to that as opposed to adding ignore below to keep consistent
